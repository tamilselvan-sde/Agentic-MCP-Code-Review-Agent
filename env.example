# MCP Configuration
# Path to the GitHub MCP server executable or command (e.g., npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github)
# However, if it's already running in Podman, we need to know how to connect.
# The prompt says "fetching PR data via GitHub MCP Server (running in Podman)".
# Usually, this means we communicate via stdio if we launch it, or via a transport if it's a network service.
# For now, I'll assume we run it via npx or similar if we can't connect to a running one.
# But wait, the system has github-mcp-server available in the tool definitions.
# I should probably use the tools provided by the environment if possible, 
# but the prompt asks for a "local system" that uses "GitHub MCP Server as the only GitHub interface".
# This implies the Python code should call the MCP server.
